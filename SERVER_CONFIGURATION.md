Exploring the Blockchain
As weâ€™ve already discussed, the ability for anyone to view a public blockchain such as the one associated with virtual currencies like Bitcoin is a key factor in why it works as well as it does. The easiest way to peruse this distributed database is through a block explorer, typically hosted on a free-to-use website such as Blockchain.info.

Most blockchain explorers are heavily indexed and easily searchable, allowing you to locate transactions in a number of different ways including by IP address, block hash or other relevant data points.
