Other Uses for Blockchain
Blockchain has come to the forefront of many discussions because of its role in the distribution of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In the long run, however, these digital cash transactions may end up being a very small part of blockchain technologyâ€™s overall footprint on the world as a whole and the way we transfer assets online.

The possibilities for blockchain implementation seem endless, as its underlying technology can be leveraged in virtually any field to perform a number of important tasks such as the following.

Executing contracts
Safely buying and selling intellectual property
Distributing important medical information
Ensuring that voting in elections is incorruptible
We, as a world society, have just begun to scratch the surface here. New potential uses for blockchain are being discovered on a regular basis.

Private blockchains will allow companies to revolutionize their own internal processes while public, open-source variations will continue to change the way we handle business in our daily lives.
